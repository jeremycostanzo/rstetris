# rstetris

This is a tetris clone that I created using the sdl2 rust crate.

# Install
Install the sdl2 lib, for instance on debian:
`apt-get install libsdl2-dev`

[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Clone the repo and run the game
`git clone https://github.com/jeremycostanzo/rstetris`

`cd rstetris`

`cargo run --release`

# How to play
- h: move the piece one block to the left
- l: move the piece one block to the right
- hold j: the piece goes down faster
- i: the piece goes down as far as it can go
- k: rotate the piece clockwise
